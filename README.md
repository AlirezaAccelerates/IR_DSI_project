📌 This project investigates a  methodology in information retrieval (IR), moving away from the conventional systems that separate indexing from retrieval. Drawing inspiration from the Differentiable Search Index (DSI) concept, we have developed a unified Transformer language model that integrates both indexing and retrieval processes. Trained using the MS MARCO dataset and enhanced with the Pyserini library, this model aims to enhance retrieval effectiveness by auto-regressively generating relevant document identifiers (docids).
